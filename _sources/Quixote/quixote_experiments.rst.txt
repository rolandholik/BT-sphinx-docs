Launching Gnome calculator
..........................

When trying to model behaviour of apps with graphical user interface (GUI),
first app that came to mind was calculator. Since we were using Ubuntu 22.04
with default gnome desktop environment --- gnome-calculator is the one we ended
up trying.

As we can see below, creation of the model happens without any apparent issues.

However, when trying to enforce the model we were not met with much success ---
segmentation-fault.

Subsequent tries ended up with straight up denial.
